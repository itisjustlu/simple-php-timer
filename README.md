# Simple php timer
This is a simple solution for managing dates in php. There is no need to research how
to print dates. All you need is right here!


### How to install?
Run in your terminal
```
composer require lucasruroken/simple-php-timer
```

or just add into your composer.php
```
"require": {
    "lucasruroken/simple-php-timer": "~1.0"
},
```

### How to use?
First of all, you need to include the **Timer** class
```
use LucasRuroken\SimplePhpTimer\Timer;
```

and then wherever you want to get a datetime
```
echo (new Timer())->today();
```

This will print the current date. Note that the default format is **Y-m-d H:i:s**
You can simple override this by passing a format function
```
echo (new Timer())->today()->format('Y-d');
```

If you want, you can create a custom date like this
```
echo (new Timer())->yearsAgo(2)->monthsAgo(2);
```
This prints 2 years and 2 months ago

```
echo (new Timer())->years(3)->days(2);
```
This prints 3 years and 2 days from today

If you don't like to type **(new Timer())->function();**, 
you are able to call a static function
```
echo Timer::create()->yesterday();
```
